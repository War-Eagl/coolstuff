### Its me, your cool friend **Vishal**. I'm Engineering student by day. But I'm a Machine Learning guy by night (🤫 that's my secret identity). But besides that, I have more tricks in my sleeve, too. For example, I love public speaking, Tamil Language, Stories (Fantasies, especially), Cats, Philosophy, Movies, .... ughhh I don't want to bore you with this silly list. But did I mention about my Cat love??? 😍😍😍

### Feel free to hit me up on the my social media handles below for suggestions, comments, etc. You can also DM me for chit chat, small talk, being friends with me (seriously, I appreciate it), or sending cat pics 😍😍😍.
